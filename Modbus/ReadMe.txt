About my library
----------------

My library is completly free, you can do anything with it...so enjoy it!!!
I've written all classes in a single .cs file in mode that you can have all functions grouped in a single
file that you can include everywhere. Naturally, if you want use a compiled version of it, a 
stand-alone .dll can be found in the release directory.
